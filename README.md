# Ziti Open-Core Executables

Ziti is a modern, programmable network overlay with associated edge components, for application-embedded, zero trust network connectivity, written by developers for developers. Ziti allows developers to take control of networking while with secure connectivity and advanced security concepts such as Zero Trust.

This repository contains the executables as configured in the open-core release of Ziti. The underlying `ziti-edge` and `ziti-fabric` components are rolled up and configured into the binaries that we ship.
