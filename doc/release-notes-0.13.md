# Theme

  * Changes to make working with policies easier, including
      * New APIs to list existing role attributes used by edge routers, identities and services
      
# Making Policies More User Friendly 
## Listing Role Attributes in Use

There are three new endpoints for listing role attributes in use. 

    * Endpoint: /edge-router-role-attributes
    * Endpoint: /identity-role-attributes
    * Endpoint: /service-role-attributes
    
All three support the same operations:

    * Supported operations
        * List: GET
            * Supports filtering
            * role attributes can be filtered/sorted using the symbol `id`
            * Ex:`?filter=id contains "north" limit 5`
            
The CLI supports these new operations as well.

    ziti edge controller list edge-router-role-attributes
    ziti edge controller list identity-role-attributes
    ziti edge controller list service-role-attributes
    
Example output:

    $ ec list service-role-attributes "true sort by id desc limit 5" -j
    {
        "meta": {
            "filterableFields": [
                "id"
            ],
            "pagination": {
                "limit": 5,
                "offset": 0,
                "totalCount": 10
            }
        },
        "data": [
            "two",
            "three",
            "support",
            "sales",
            "one"
        ]
    }
